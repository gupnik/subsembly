# Runtime Execution

## Prerequisites

This section assumes that you have already initialised new **Subsembly** project and have generated the chain specification file. And also have converted the chain specification file into raw.

## Run with Substrate Node

Eventually, our aim is to be able to run **Substrate** node with a compiled **Subsembly** runtime that is placed in the chain specification file. This is currently work in progress.

But for running **Subsembly** runtimes for now oyu have to use our customised Substrate node. More information on that can be found in the following [guide](../guides/create-your-first-subsembly-runtime/).
