description: Substrate runtimes in AssemblyScript

# Introduction

## `Subsembly`

### What is it?

**`Subsembly`** is a framework used for designing and implementing Substrate runtimes from scratch. **`Subsembly`** utilises Substrate Core to build runtimes in a non-native language of Substrate. With **`Subsembly`** you can build Substrate runtimes rapidly, with a varying degrees of technical freedom.

### How does it work?

**`Substrate`** runtimes can be designed in any other language than Rust, provided that the language targets **`WebAssembly`**. This is where **`AssemblyScript`** and **`Subsembly`** come into play.

### Funding and Support

**`Subsembly`** is funded by [**Web3 Foundation**](https://web3.foundation) **Grants** and developed, maintained by [**LimeChain**](https://limechain.tech).
