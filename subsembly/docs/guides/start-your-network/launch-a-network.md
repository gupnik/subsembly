# Launch Validator Nodes

## Introduction

We are going to launch the 2 validator nodes of the network - **Alice** and **Bob**.

## Alice Starts the Node

The prerequisite for this step is a compiled runtime and generated chain spec file. Refer to [**Development**](../../development/development.md) section or to [previous](../create-your-first-subsembly-runtime/) guide on how to do it.

Alice runs the following commands inside the **Subsembly** project root folder:

```text
make run-node \
NAME=node01 \
PORT=30333 \
WS-PORT=9944 \
RPC-PORT=9933 \
spec=raw-chain-spec.json \
-- --validator
```

What do those flags represent?

```text
NAME= Specifies the name of your Node
PORT = Specifies the port that your node will listen for p2p traffic on
WS-PORT = Specifies the port that your node will listen for p2p traffic on
RPC-PORT = Specifies the port that your node will listen for incoming RPC traffic on
spec = Specifies path to the raw chain spec file
OTHER = Specifies additional flags/options to provide to the node. In this case, we want our node to be validator
```

More details about the flags and other options for the node, can be explored with the following command:

```text
make run-node help=1
```

After launching the node, you should see the following output:

```

We copy Alice's node identity to use it when we are connecting other nodes to Alice's:

```text
Mar 25 16:11:41.726  INFO üè∑  Local node identity is: 12D3KooWGtgEa8AuxLMnuKf71qE1bPb2nGKXbgmyjhC5G1w7Yrrf (legacy representation: 12D3KooWGtgEa8AuxLMnuKf71qE1bPb2nGKXbgmyjhC5G1w7Yrrf)
```

## Connect to PolkadotJs

Once your node is running, go to PolkadotJS interface at [https://polkadot.js.org/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps). PolkadotJS interface provides an interface for interacting with your node and it should automatically connect to your local node:

## Bob Joins

In a separate terminal, run the node for Bob:

```text
make run-node \
PORT=30334 \
WS-PORT=9945 \
RPC-PORT=9934 \
spec=raw-chain-spec.json \
NAME=node02 \
-- --validator \
--bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/12D3KooWEyoppNCUx8Yx66oV9fJnriXwCcXwDDUA2kj6vnc6iDEp
```

We can notice some differences compared to the command used to run Alice's node. We changed the ports and name of the node, since two nodes can not have the same name and one port can not be exposed from two different nodes.

Most importantly, we added a **`--bootnodes`** flag, to specify a single boot node of Alice. Here, the value of **`--bootnodes`** flag is comprised of following properties:

* Alice's IP Address, localhost or `127.0.0.1`
* Alice's Port, she specified `30333`
* Alice's Peer ID, we copied it in the Alice's section

After running the command you should see the output similar to this:

```

As you see from the output \(**`1 peers`**\), Bob successfully connected to the Alice's node:

```text

```

You can also connect this node to PolkadotJs interface. To do that, you will need to change the **`ws`** port in the left tab in the main page \(`9945` in this case\)

### Insert Keys

After we launched the nodes and they are successfully connected, we have to insert their respective Aura keys to start the block production.

**Important**

The params that you are providing in the curl request are the mnemonic and public key generated in step 1.

Insert the keys for **Alice**:

```text
curl --location --request POST '0.0.0.0:9933' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "author_insertKey",
    "params": ["aura","dice height enter anger ahead chronic easily wave curious banana era happy","0xdcc1461cba689c60dcae053ef09bc9e9524cdceb696ce39c7ed43bf3a5fa9659"],
    "id": 1
}'
```

Keep in mind that your params will be different, since the generated mnemonic/pub key tuple will be different from this one! The first part of the "params" is the mnemonic and the last parameter is the public key both derived the subkey generation.

We do the same for **Bob**:

```text
curl --location --request POST '0.0.0.0:9933' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "author_insertKey",
    "params": ["aura","lady demand candy vacuum warm nurse shaft garment horror list burst strike","0xec9fd69c119fb45b6f6efca397db3e864649e6903cf227d4609ed53a66d3bf1e"],
    "id": 1
}'
```

If you see this output, you have successfully inserted the keys:

```text
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":null,"id":1}
```

You will notice that nodes will start producing new blocks:

```

If you inserted the keys for both nodes correctly, you should see blocks beeing produced every 5 seconds.
